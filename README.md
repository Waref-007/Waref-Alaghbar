# 👨‍💻 Waref Alaghbar

**Aerospace Engineer | AI Master's Student | Design Engineering Project Manager at British Airways**

Hi, I’m Waref — an Aerospace Engineering graduate from the University of Salford, currently completing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds. Since graduation, I’ve been working with British Airways as a Design Engineering Project Manager, bridging the technical and operational sides of aircraft design, system upgrades, and change management.

I bring a hybrid background in **engineering design, systems thinking, and AI**, with experience in everything from computational modeling and PID control to machine learning and data science. My current work blends domain expertise in aviation with predictive modeling, optimization, and insight-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Goals

I’m passionate about applying AI to real-world systems — not just to optimize performance, but to serve people. One of my long-term goals is to design a scalable AI-driven model that supports **post-conflict reconstruction**, particularly in countries like Syria, by integrating infrastructure recovery, resource distribution, and socio-economic data. Technology can rebuild more than systems — it can rebuild hope.
